This repository showcases a Power BI dashboard analyzing a bankâ€™s loan portfolio. The project demonstrates how data visualization can be applied to monitor loan performance, assess credit risk, and support decision-making in the banking sector.

#Objective

The goal of this project is to design an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of the loan portfolio, enabling:

Monitoring of disbursements, repayments, and overdue loans.

Identification of high-risk loans and Non-Performing Assets (NPAs).

Better decision-making for credit risk management and policy adjustments.

#Business Relevance

This dashboard is directly aligned with the core functions of financial institutions like Banks, where efficient loan portfolio management is critical.

Loan Monitoring: Track loan disbursements, credit score and high risk borrower percentage in real time.

Credit Risk Analysis: Identify high-risk borrower percentage, rejection rate and delinquency patterns for proactive risk control.

Decision-Making Support: Equip management with insights to optimize lending policies, allocate funds, and evaluate portfolio health.

Regulatory Alignment: Supports compliance monitoring and reporting, essential in the banking industry.

By bridging analytics with business needs, this project demonstrates how Power BI can enhance operational efficiency, reduce risk, and drive profitability in the banking domain.
