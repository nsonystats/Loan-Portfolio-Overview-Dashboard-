# Loan-Portfolio-Overview-Dashboard-
This repository showcases a Power BI dashboard analyzing a bankâ€™s loan portfolio. The project demonstrates how data visualization can be applied to monitor loan performance, assess credit risk, and support decision-making in the banking sector.

#Objective

The goal of this project is to design an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of the loan portfolio, enabling:

Monitoring of disbursements, repayments, and overdue loans.

Identification of high-risk loans and Non-Performing Assets (NPAs).

Better decision-making for credit risk management and policy adjustments.
